<h2>Video games</h2>
<p>I end up spending the majority of my free time on my computer playing a game of some sort. Whether I am playing a MMO with friends, or a survival game, or even a horror game! </p>
<p>I also love playing party games with my girlfriend and friends like Mario party, or uno as well.</p>

<h2>Reading</h2> 
<p>I love reading all kinds of books. My favorite would be fantasy and horror books, like the Eragon book series.</p>   
<p>I am also a huge fan of reading comic books and manga as well too when time permits.</p>
